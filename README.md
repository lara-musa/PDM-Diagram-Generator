# PDM-Diagram-Generator
This project offers a straightforward HTML solution for generating PDM style diagrams. It is meant to be used in project managnet contexts.

## âœ© Overview
This project provides a drag-and-drop template for creating PDMs with editable text fields. This solution is perfect for users who want a clean, intuitive way to put together PDM diagrams quickly and without the hassle of tediously moving around many task boxes and interestingly shaped arrows. The tables include textfields for **early start**, **early finish**, **late start**, **late finish**, **task duration**, and **total slack / float**. 

## âŠ¹ Why This Solution?
While I would generally reccomend [**Mermaid**](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagam generation since its code based and easy to adit, but it can be challenging for creating and managing PDM-style tables. Using powerpoint or similar diagram editing software is too tedious, and drawing diagrams by hand is not very professional looking. This HTML-based approach provides:
* Great Control over table structure.
* Simplicity in Editing by allowing users to click and fill in cells.
* Ease of Arrangement to achieve professional-looking diagrams with minimal effort.

##  âžœ Usage
1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Specify the number of tasks you want to generate.
3. Input task succession relationships according to the specified format.
4. Adjust the tables by dragging them to desired positions on the canvas for a clear, cohesive diagram.
5. Click on any table cell to add or change text as needed.

## ð–¦¹ Customization
* Experiment with table placement to achieve an ideal flow and enhance readability.
* Feel free to apply CSS to customize the colors, borders, and layout of your tables for a unique look.

## âŒ• Troubleshooting
* If tables overlap or donâ€™t align perfectly, try repositioning them to optimize layout.
* If text fields donâ€™t seem editable, ensure that youâ€™re in a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Hopefully in the Future
I'm hoping to edit this code when I have time to accept critical path input and highlight it in red, or better yet, perhaps calculate the critical path according to user task duration input.
